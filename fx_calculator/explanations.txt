Create a new project

This is the basic structure of a javafx app

Create a new fxml document

Open with Scene Builder

Follw me

- Resize the VBOX to the desired size
(I used 320 x 240)

- Drag textfield and gridpane

- Drag buttons to the gridpane
  Change fx:id property

- The fx:ids will be used in the code
to identify the controls

- Set a new Controller
 The controller is a class which manages this
fxml document


- Create event handlers
Event handlers are methods that will be
called when a button is clicked


- Now let us do the controller class 
which is Main.java

- Generate Controller


When a number is clicked append it
to the existing input
So it will work for multiple digit numbers

When clear is clicked
clear the text box and reset the variables
choice = 0 means no operator is clicked


When + is clicked.
set Choice is 1
Take the current value of the text field
Convert it to double
Store it in num1
Then clear the text field


When / is clicked
set Choice to 2
Take the current value of the textfield
Convert to double
Store it in num1
Then clear the text field


When equals is clicked

Take the current value of the textfield
Convert it to double
Store it in num2
Then clear the text field

Then check which operator is selected
This info is stored in choice variable

if choice is 1
result = num1 + num2
set result to the textfield

if choice is 2
result = num1/ num2
set result to the textfield

Time to test the calculator

The controller for Main.fxml is MainController.java

Let us change that 

Amazing it is working

Change the title of the window

Disable Maximize


Hope you understood everything
