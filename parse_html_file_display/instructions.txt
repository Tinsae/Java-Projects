I opened your project in eclipse

Commented line 16 and line 17
on Runner.java

Create a file playlist.txt
and put it in the project directory

I read the file and printed all lines

See the code and output. It works

Now let us implement the specific task

It correctly prints the titles

The function returns ArrayList<String>

So instead of printing we need to add
the titles to an arraylist and return
that arraylist

it works. Do the same on your computer and
it shall work.

Comment out the test codes we wrote and
let us move to the next function


The next function requires to be called 
from extractTitlesFromFile

So insted of splitting each line in 
extractTitlesFromFile,
we can pass the line to getSongName
and getSongName will return the songName

getSongName will recieve a line
and will split the line to obtain and
return the title

Quick test. It worked. Do the same.

We might have to getArtist as well

Earlier we only added the song titles without
artist name. 

Let us modify it to include artist name 

It is working now. Do the same on your computer

Seprating them by - makes sense 

Let me show you how to save the top 100

and that will be enough for this lesson


Quick test


Check the file


As you have seen it worked


That is enough for now. 
I spent 2 horus on this lesson
