In this lesson I am going to show 
how to integrate the functions to the GUI


* The class implements ActionListener
* See the comments on the code
* comment all unneccessariy code 
from Runner.java

Before testing, add this code so that
when a button is clicked the appropriate 
function is called

Quick test

Select the html file we downloaded

As you can see it loads it

Now let us try saving this to a new file

Let us create a new file

As you can see the file is empty

It is done!

Let us check the file

It works


That is all for this lesson. 

Thanks
