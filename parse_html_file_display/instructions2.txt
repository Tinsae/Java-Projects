Inspect element and see where 
the the artist name, music title and rank
are in the html file

These are the three places. The same for
all titles


Install jsoup
It as simple as downloading the jar file
and connecting it with the project


Next I am going to show you
how to extract text from html tags

Import the libraries


Save the html file inside project directory

Read the html file using buffered reader

Merge all lines into one string


chart-list-item contains everything 
we need.

So we are required to extract only that 
tag


We can iterate over all titles like this


Quick test. It seems to work

Moving on to the other functions


In order to use the other functions

We have to redo the first function


Doing it seprately instead of reading
one div tag for both

Quick test


The song name is in a span tag


Moving to the thrid function

saveToFile will work

Let us add the rank


Quick test



It works

Honestely speaking I spent around
2 hours to understand html parsing
and explain it to you.

That is for this lesson

On an another lesson I will show you
how to integrate this to the 
graphical user interface


Thanks
