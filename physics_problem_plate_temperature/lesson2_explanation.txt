Welcome to the next lesson


The remaining part is to

update the array until it is stable

The array section that needs to be updated

ranges from 

1,1  to 10,1
10,1 to 10,10

The new temperatue is the average
of the four surrounding temperatures

See the new temperature for the first 68
is the average of its neigbors

Let me show you another one


Very clear right?

Moving to eclipse

Check the formula. We need these five indices

i-1, j
i, j-1
i, j
i, j+1
i+1, j
______

We calculate the average of these five
for each grid of the plate


If a change is less than 0.1 then it is not
significant

Let me rename the variable to make it clear


significantFound is better name



This update is going to performed many times
until all grid changes in the given plate
are not signficant

So I will add an outer while loop for that


Time to test !!


Let us reformat the decimals and the output


Now let us align them in columns


Formatting the numbers between the updates

may create numerical instability

so let us do the formatting and column alignment

only during print


Looks good, now let us check the numbers


The numbers are not the same


Let us check the code for mistakes


Now it is better


I used absolute value to calculate the changes

because when colder temperature is 
given on the edges, the plate temperature 
will decrease

whe hotter temperature is given on the edges

the plate temperature will increase

so absolute value of the differnce is checked

When many updates are on floating point numbers
computers are not exactly precise

So the numbers may not exactly match with 
the given output on the question 
But they will be similar numbers

Check it in your computer.
This same code may not produce exactly
the same precision numbers. 

There are precision and rounding errors

Compare the outputs they are very close

Hope you are satisfied. If you need more help
I am avaialble on the chat 

It was a nice lesson


Cheers
