There are three classes in this project

* Plate
* Lab3
* Lab3Test

A Plate object is represented as array of numbers
// instance variable
double [] plate
// constructor
Plate(double [] plate)
{}
This is the constructor of Plate. It takes a 2D array
and initializes its instance variable

Lab3 contains one method
plate[] processTempsFromFile(File f, int num_of_plates)
{}
* A file contains multiple lines where each line
contains four numbers seprated by comma
* We can use BufferedReader and FileReader classes
to read the file line by line.
* num_of_plates tells the number of lines we need to read
* the method returns array of plates

Lab3Test will contain the main method
In the main method we can add code in order to
call processTempsFromFile with some file and num of plates
and display results to the console screen.

Hope the above explanations gave you idea about 
the overall structure of the project

Let us proceed to eclipse

Create a java project


Create the classes

Use the given package edu.ben.labs.lab3

Starting from the Plate class

Moving to Lab3


Most of the hard code will be in this function


The four corners of the 12 by 12 array are not used

The blue shaded regions are sized 10

Top goes from row 0 colum 1
to row 0 column 10

Bottom goes from 11,1 to 11,10

Left goes from 1,0 to 10,0

Rigt goes from 11,11 to 10,11


Before moving on let us test the program

So first create a file and place it
in the project

It needs some fix because it is returning
zeros in the middle but they should be
69.

And the edges should be 0 instead of 69


Now it is working. 

I spent 2 hours for this lesson

Let us follow it up with a one hour 
live lesson or another 1 hour written
lesson


Hope you understood everything

Cheers
