The day his father passed away Left him with a lil' somethin' sixteen he was stuntin' Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy Hit Lake Shore girls go all crazy Hit the freeway go at least 'bout eighty Boned so much that summer even had him a baby See back-back then-then if you had a car You was the Chi-Town version of Baby And I was just a virgin a baby One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall They had they Lincolns and Auroras we was hurtin' 'em all With the girls a lotta flirtin' involved but dawg Fuck all that flirtin' I'm tryna get in some drawers so Put me on with these hoes homie He told me don't rush to get grown drive slow homie Drive slow homie drive slow homie You never know homie might meet some hoes homie You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie What it do?
